# E-Voting System

### Introduction
This E-Voting system is an MVP of the previously created design. With a focus on casting a vote, the user is able to log into the system, be shown multiple candiates for a single election. The candidates are popuated by an external data store, with the vote they have been given, and an admin can login to the system to see which votes have been given to each. 
The overall system has been implemented according to the design, with the flow matching what is shown in the wireframes. Documention that is provided with the project describes and illustrates the implemention.

After checking your not a robot, if logged in as a user, you're brought to a screen describing how the voting system works, and how to vote for a candidate. Selecting next, you're now able to select from the candidates, and submit your vote. Finally, the screen moves to the confirmation, where you can either go back, or successfully put your vote in. Ending the session now brings you back to the login screen.
Logging in as admin allows you to view the total votes for the candidates in an easy to read format.
